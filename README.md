# lib_ICP
An ICP library developed in conjunction with [dev_slam](https://github.com/Nianzu/dev_slam) for the [Navie project](https://github.com/Nianzu/Navie).

Work on this project is guided by Dr. Kaveh Fathian as part of the Graduate course Robotic Mapping & Localization (CSCI 598B) @ Colorado School of Mines Spring 2024, but all work is my own alone.

The design of this library is based on the python implementation [here](https://github.com/ClayFlannigan/icp/blob/master/icp.py).
